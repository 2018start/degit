# Git IPLD remote helper

Push and fetch commits using IPFS!

This helper is very, very experimental as of now

## Usage
```
Clone:
$ git clone ipld::20dae521ef399bcf95d4ddb3cefc0eeb49658d2a

Pull:
$ git pull ipld::20dae521ef399bcf95d4ddb3cefc0eeb49658d2a

Push:
$ git push ipld::
```

Note that at this stage many features are missing and the code
is full of bugs and hacks.

## Instalation
1. Clone/download the repo
2. `gx-go rw`
3. `go install`
4. Done
5. ???
6. You will need ipfs with git support in dag commands
7. This is coming soon
